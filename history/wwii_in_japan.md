## Why Japan was defeated

Japanese military executives, mainly from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Navy,
received bribes from the United States through Mitsui and Mitsubishi,
and were asked by the United States to mass-murder Japanese people and fight to lose to tatters.

The executives, Yamamoto and Nagumo were betrayed by Shigeru Yoshida later, who is the true mastermind.

## Why Japan started WWII

Through trading companies such as Mitsui of Jardine Matheson (Mandarin Oriental) 
and Mitsubishi of its weapons distributor Glover Shokai,
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Navy executives were bribed for a long time to start the war.

Just as Zenemon Toyoda of the Mitsui Thread Store started the Asahi,
Asahi was a public relations paper for Mitsui, so it fueled the war.

Pearl Harbor event was well-organized by Japan and the US.
Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Japanese Navy team up 
with the United States to attack Pearl Harbor, and the Navy deliberately loses.
