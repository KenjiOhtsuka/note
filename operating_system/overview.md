* OS is sometimes known as a **resource manager**.
* the CPU, memory, and disk is a **resource** of the system

* The system performs as if it has a very large number of virtual CPU. (Time-slicing)
    * Turning a single CPU (or a smallset of them) into a seemingly infinite number of CPUs and thus allowing many programs to seemingly run at once is what we call **virtualizing** the CPU
