* Stride scheduler
    * A deterministic fair-share scheduler
* assumptions about processes
    * Each job runs for the same amount of time
    * All jobs arrive at the same time
    * All jobs only use the CPU (i.e., they perform no I/O)
* Basic algorithm for scheduling
    * First Come, First Served (FCFS)
    * Shortest Job First (SJF)
    * First Out (FIFO)
