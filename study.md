    * This type is employed when the instructor wants to see our thoughts and critical thinking rather than our memory power.
    * Creating index for our notes is effective.
* Take-home tests
    * It is like open-book tests.
    * We can take test any time we want.
    * The instructor expect more detail and complete work,
    because we are not under a strict time limit and we can see references freely
* Online tests

    * Check if we can move freely between test sections to go back and check our work,
    or we can skip question and look back later.
