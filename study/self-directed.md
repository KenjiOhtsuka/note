* self-determination theory
    * Understanding motivation a person has to do something because it is inherently interesting to them

## Tips

1. Identify my learning goals.
    * I can't achieve what I haven’t envisioned.
2. Question the significance of things.
    * Make a habit of **not taking things** for face value.
3. Seek out interesting challenges.
4. Monitor my own learning process.
    * To set my own standards.
5. Understand my own approach.
6. Use game-based motivation strategies.
    * Give myself fun reasons to challenge myself and work hard.
7. Start with background on a topic.
    * Get to know my topic by reading the Wiki page on it first.
    * It’s important to have context before I dive into details.
8. Cultivate intrinsic motivation.
    * Intrinsic motivation doesn’t come naturally to everyone, but it can be learned.
    * Help myself enjoy learning more by collecting interesting facts or planning to share my knowledge with other people.
9. Share my learning with peers and mentors.
    * My attention and memory both receive a boost when I picture myself relaying new material to another person.
10. Create something out of what I’ve learned.
    * Make a habit of creating something–a diagram, a song, a journal entry– with the new material I’ve learned.
    * Not only will it help solidify the material in my long term memory, but it will also help I look forward to future learning endeavors.
11. Build my own personal learning syllabus.
    * Now’s my chance. Learn what I want, when I want, how I want.
12. Use time (or lack thereof) to my advantage.
    * We’re all busy, but sometimes this can be an advantage.
    * Take the thirty minutes I have during my lunch hour or post-work session at the gym to complete a “unit” on a topic of interest.
13. Pursue knowledge, not good grades.
    * It’s hard to ignore grades when they seem to mean so much to university admissions staff.
    * But it’s important to keep in mind that they aren’t the end-all-be-all.
    * Grades don’t always reflect how much I’ve actually learned, and that’s what counts in the end.
14. Create my own personal learning record.
    * There are so many great tools out there to help I document my learning.
    * Have some fun with a digital learning portfolio– especially ten years down the road when I'm going through my old notes and projects!
15. Verbalise my achievements.
    * It’s one thing to know what I’ve learned; it’s quite another to make it known.
    * Verbalising my achievements can be extremely rewarding, and can help I reflect on what I think I’ve learned vs. what I’ve actually learned.
16. Make a list of topics “to master.”
    * Creating a list of topics to master is almost as fun as crossing them off.
    * Remember to make concrete, easily-achievable goals as well as more general, overarching ones.
17. Practise using what I’ve learned.
    * We all value knowledge we can actually use. Sometimes we need to make an effort to use it, though.
    * Create my own opportunities to use my knowledge and I’ll find the results very rewarding.
18. Value progress over performance.
    * We never stop learning, and that’s one of the many reasons why self-directed learning can be so enjoyable.
    * Countless topics, questions, and problems means countless opportunities to feel stimulated and accomplished.
19. Keep my goals realistic.
    * unrealistic goals. It’s easy to get discouraged when we don’t achieve what we want to.
20. Build a network of “learning colleagues.”
