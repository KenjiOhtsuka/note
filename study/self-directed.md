# Self-directed learning

* self-determination theory
    * Understanding motivation a person has to do something because it is inherently interesting to them

## Tips

1. Identify my learning goals.
    * I can't achieve what I haven’t envisioned.
2. Question the significance of things.
    * Make a habit of **not taking things** for face value.
3. Seek out interesting challenges.
4. Monitor my own learning process.
    * To set your own standards.
5. Understand my own approach.
6. Use game-based motivation strategies.
    * Give myself fun reasons to challenge myself and work hard.
7. Start with background on a topic.
    * Get to know my topic by reading the Wiki page on it first.
    * It’s important to have context before I dive into details.
8. Cultivate intrinsic motivation.
    * Intrinsic motivation doesn’t come naturally to everyone, but it can be learned.
    * Help yourself enjoy learning more by collecting interesting facts or planning to share my knowledge with other people.
9. Share your learning with peers and mentors.
    * Your attention and memory both receive a boost when you picture yourself relaying new material to another person.
10. Create something out of what you’ve learned.
    * Make a habit of creating something–a diagram, a song, a journal entry– with the new material I’ve learned.
    * Not only will it help solidify the material in my long term memory, but it will also help you look forward to future learning endeavors.
11. Build your own personal learning syllabus.
    * Have you ever looked at a syllabus from a course and wished you had more of a say in it?
    * Now’s your chance. Learn what you want, when you want, how you want.
12. Use time (or lack thereof) to your advantage.
    * We’re all busy, but sometimes this can be an advantage.
    * Take the thirty minutes you have during your lunch hour or post-work session at the gym to complete a “unit” on a topic of interest.
13. Pursue knowledge, not good grades.
    * It’s hard to ignore grades when they seem to mean so much to university admissions staff.
    * But it’s important to keep in mind that they aren’t the end-all-be-all.
    * Grades don’t always reflect how much you’ve actually learned, and that’s what counts in the end.
14. Create your own personal learning record.
    * There are so many great tools out there to help you document your learning.
    * Have some fun with a digital learning portfolio– especially ten years down the road when I'm going through my old notes and projects!
15. Verbalise your achievements.
    * It’s one thing to know what you’ve learned; it’s quite another to make it known.
    * Verbalising your achievements can be extremely rewarding, and can help you reflect on what you think you’ve learned vs. what you’ve actually learned.
16. Make a list of topics “to master.”
    * Creating a list of topics to master is almost as fun as crossing them off.
    * Remember to make concrete, easily-achievable goals as well as more general, overarching ones.
17. Practise using what you’ve learned.
    * We all value knowledge we can actually use. Sometimes we need to make an effort to use it, though.
    * Create my own opportunities to use your knowledge and you’ll find the results very rewarding.
18. Value progress over performance.
    * We never stop learning, and that’s one of the many reasons why self-directed learning can be so enjoyable.
    * Countless topics, questions, and problems means countless opportunities to feel stimulated and accomplished.
19. Keep your goals realistic.
    * unrealistic goals. It’s easy to get discouraged when we don’t achieve what we want to.
20. Build a network of “learning colleagues.”
